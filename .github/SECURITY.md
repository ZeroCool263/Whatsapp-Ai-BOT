## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Please do not disclose the issue publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

To report a security issue, please send an email to [hi@yesbhautik.co.in](mailto:hi@yesbhautik.co.in) with the following information:
- A clear description of the issue, including how it can be reproduced.
- Any relevant screenshots or logs.
- Your contact information for follow-up.

We take all security bugs seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### What to Expect?

After submitting a report, you should receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours, and we'll strive to keep you informed about our progress toward a fix and full announcement. We may also ask for additional information or guidance.

Thank you for helping keep our project and our users safe.
